# CSC6220-Parallel-Algorithm
This repo holds projects I wrote in C for a masters Comp Sci course in Parallel Computing and Algorithms.

Written in the Ubuntu 20.04 - Linux CMD txt editor GNU nano and compiled with GNU.

Job scripts were written through a PuTTy connection or Windows CMD ip address handshake over VPN in the Wayne GRID (HPC).

NOTE: Some projects were written with a companioned job script in order to run on the Wayne State Univeristy GRID Computer.


The majority of files you'll find here are large input matrix arthimetic utilizing low level parallel methods like multithreading, openMP, and MPI.





This class was beyond interesting and getting to do it as an undergrad was a privilege in it self. It felt daunting, sitting around 3rd year 
masters students or even phd students. There was definitely a learning curve but once I sat down and put the time and effort in, everything made
sense. 

By far the best part was sending the job request out and waiting for it to compile on the HPC and then it worked... or showed any sign of working
to begin with. If you haven't already I can't suggest enough that you learn parallel computing.
