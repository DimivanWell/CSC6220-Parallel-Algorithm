# CSC6220-Parallel-Algorithm
This repo holds projects I wrote in C for a masters Comp Sci course in Parallel Computing and Algorithms.

Written in the Ubuntu 20.04 - Linux CMD txt editor GNU nano and compiled with GNU.

Job scripts were written through a PuTTy connection or Windows CMD ip address handshake over VPN in the Wayne GRID (HPC).

NOTE: Some projects were written with a companioned job script in order to run on the Wayne State Univeristy GRID Computer.


The majority of files you'll find here are large input matrix arthimetic utilizing low level parallel methods like multithreading, openMP, and MPI.
