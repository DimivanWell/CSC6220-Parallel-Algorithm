# CSC6220-Parallel-Algorithm
This repo holds projects I wrote in C for a masters Comp Sci course in Parallel Computing and Algorithms.

Written in the Ubuntu 20.04 - Linux CMD txt editor GNU nano and compiled with GNU.

Job scripts were written through a PuTTy connection over VPN in the Wayne GRID.

NOTE: Some projects were written with a companioned job script in order to run on the Wayne State Univeristy GRID Computer.
