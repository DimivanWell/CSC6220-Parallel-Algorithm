This class was beyond interesting and getting to do it as an undergrad was a privilege in it self. It felt daunting, sitting around 3rd year 
masters students or even phd students. There was definitely a learning curve but once I sat down and put the time and effort in, everything made
sense. 

By far the best part was sending the job request out and waiting for it to compile on the HPC and then it worked... or showed any sign of working
to begin with. If you haven't already I can't suggest enough that you learn parallel computing.
